\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank every one, from friends and colleagues to family, who in one way or another helped achieve this life goal.\\
There are however a couple of you who have been there all along, helping me raise the bar day by day, namely my parents, Sancho and Susana, to whom I hold deep gratitude for everything they have done throughout my whole life, my girlfriend, Mariana, who was there all along offering unconditional support, my aunts and uncles, Madalena, Júlio, Maurício and Catarina who offered me more than I could ask for and without whom I could not get all the way to where I am, and my dear friend João, who through countless lunch hours put up with my problems and supported me along the way.\\
Last but definitely not least, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisors, Professor Fernando Mira da Silva and Professor Luís Guerra e Silva, for excellent mentorship and all the support given that at times went beyond the role of advisor.

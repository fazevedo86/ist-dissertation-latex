% Traditional network paradigm & management problem
Today's computer networks are essentially sets of interconnected network nodes. 
These nodes are mainly proprietary black boxes that allow for data input/output, exposing a configuration interface through which network operators can configure its behavior by means of a vendor specific configuration workflow and interface.
These black boxes are typically switches and routers that implement, in software and/or hardware, a set of standard or proprietary protocols that allow them to communicate with each other and provide service to the endpoints logically or physically connected to them.
Because the process of creating and implementing new protocols is slow, and due to the complex dependency between multiple protocols running on the same node, new network features have typically been implemented resorting to middle boxes designed to perform specific functions such as Firewalls, \glspl{IDS} and \gls{WAN} optimizers, thus effectively increasing the overall complexity and in turn further aggravating the network manageability issue at hand.\\
%
% IT virtualization adding pressure
This has held true for the last couple of decades and is now an increasingly focus of attentions due to the recent trend of \gls{IT} virtualization, that has changed the typical data center environment drastically, with the number of virtual network ports surpassing that of physical network ports and the amount of virtual servers largely exceeding the number of physical servers \cite{Kreutz2014}.
However, \gls{IT} virtualization has a much deeper impact on the network infrastructure of the data center than the mere increase of network ports and hosts.
With modern \gls{IT} virtualization technology, creation, removal and relocation of \glspl{VM} between physical hosts became trivial operations.
Therefore, the concept of \gls{IaaS} has emerged, which enables the creation of elastic computing services \cite{Kreutz2014} such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) \cite{AmazonEC2}.
The \gls{IT} virtualization operations supporting \gls{IaaS} can be performed in a matter of minutes.
However, the network infrastructure also needs to be reconfigured to support the changes being made to the environment.
This operation is still done manually and often node by node, taking hours or even days to be completed.\\
%
% Existing virtualization solutions & associated problems
Modern networking approaches already introduced virtualization mechanisms, such as \gls{MPLS} for path virtualization, \gls{VLAN} for layer 2 virtualization and \gls{NAT} and \gls{VRF} for layer 3 virtualization \cite{Kreutz2014}, however, these solutions are still device-centric and therefore still require configuration to be performed node by node through the same vendor specific workflows and interfaces, meaning that there is still no global network view nor global network configuration \cite{Kreutz2014} and in some cases these mechanisms are no longer able to cope with the high density of compute instances introduced by \gls{IT} virtualization \cite{Duffy2012} thus leaving the task of network reconfiguration to still require a large amount of time, be error prone and in some cases ineffective.
As a result, networks are now the technological bottleneck that is dragging the operational workload and hindering innovation in \gls{IT}, with heavy focus on data center environments.
To that extent a new network management model is now required, one that can cope with these requirements while also being future proof.\\
%
% New generation solutions
In order to solve these issues new approaches were introduced in the past couple of years, such as \glspl{SDN} and \gls{NFV}.
These two approaches share some core concerns, such as the use of commodity hardware to implement network features, but they both aim at different goals, being complementary but not dependent on each other \cite{ETSI2014}\cite{Pate2013}.\\
%
% NFV
\gls{NFV} was proposed by the \gls{ETSI} and stems from \gls{IT} virtualization itself, proposing the virtualization of entire network node classes, such as Firewalls, Routers and \glspl{IDS}, using commodity hardware as the underlying physical infrastructure.
This approach results in the dismissal of function-specific hardware middle boxes by means of virtualization, thus easing the physical constrains of adding new features to the network, as new instances of virtualized nodes can be deployed using existing commodity hardware already in place in different regions of the network \cite{ETSI2014}.
This means that at core, \gls{NFV} attempts to improve the scalability of current networks by removing some of the hardware complexity and cost, but leaves the global network manageability issue yet to be solved.\\
%
% SDN
The current notion of \gls{SDN} was developed in Stanford University while researching for a network configuration protocol, from which resulted OpenFlow, and is an approach that keeps gaining momentum both on the academic and business environments.
\gls{SDN} refers to the architectural principles while OpenFlow is an implementation of a supporting protocol for the said architecture.
\gls{SDN} relies essentially on the decoupling of the control plane from the data plane, placing the former in a logically centralized component to be executed on commodity hardware - the \gls{SDN} Controller.\\
%
% OF
OpenFlow, being a protocol that implements \gls{SDN}, allows for network programmability in a flow-oriented fashion through a well-defined \gls{API}, providing two different approaches to do so: proactive and reactive flow programming.
While both approaches can be used simultaneously, there is a lot to be gained from the latter, which provides a mechanism to program the network to forward data based on real-time decisions taken as traffic hits the data plane, while the former provides a mean for static network programming before traffic reaches the data plane.
The reactive approach, however, has a much higher computational cost when compared to the proactive approach, since for every new traffic flow traversing the network controlled by a given \gls{SDN} controller the first packet of such flow must be sent from the OpenFlow switch receiving it to the \gls{SDN} Controller, have the \gls{SDN} controller evaluate the packet, determine appropriate action, program the OpenFlow switch accordingly, and then forward the packet back into the data plane.\\
%
% OF Problems
When applied to large scale networks, the inherent computational cost of performing the aforementioned tasks becomes far too high to be handled by a single \gls{SDN} controller instance.
One way to overcome this limitation is to have several \gls{SDN} controller instances running separately, each handling a subset of the OpenFlow switch set.
However, this approach cannot be easily implemented since network policies would have to be explicitly configured on each and every \gls{SDN} controller, which is susceptible to \gls{SDN} controller failures, requires a complex and cumbersome configuration of the OpenFlow switches or alternatively a mechanism of coordination between the instances of the \gls{SDN} controller in order to ensure equal load sharing across \gls{SDN} controllers.
Finally, for any given flow traversing multiple OpenFlow switches controlled by different \gls{SDN} controllers instances the aforementioned process would have to be executed on each \gls{SDN} controller instance involved.\\
%
\section{Objectives}
This work proposes a new architecture for OpenFlow-based \gls{SDN} controllers that offers both load balance between different \gls{SDN} controller instances and a resilient infrastructure, which enables for a scalable use of reactive flow programming, regardlessly of the network size.
This new architecture does so by relying on two key concepts: the clustering of \gls{SDN} controllers and the introduction of a load balancing layer.
The clustering mechanism takes the notion of the \gls{SDN} controller as a logically centralized component and introduces the concept of \emph{elastic \gls{SDN} controller clustering}, implementing the mechanisms necessary to scale out the \gls{SDN} controller, as needed and in real time, by providing means to on-demand add and remove \gls{SDN} controller instances from the cluster no service disruption.
The load balancing layer, which is also executed on commodity hardware, is logically situated between the OpenFlow switches and the SDN Controllers, acting as a level of indirection that assigns a controller to each OpenFlow switch in a consistent fashion that ensures an equal distribution of OpenFlow switches across all the available SDN controller instances.\\
